#[fit] What even is **WebAssembly**?  

---

# What WebAssembly is **NOT**

* a programming language
* the death of JS
* something you can just ignore cause it's gonna go away

---

# What WebAssembly **IS**

* A compilation target for other languages to compile to
* An augmentation of the abilities of JS
* But most importantly...

---

* Pretty literally* **magic(k)**

\* - no not really literally but I'll explain later

---

# WebAssmebly is a **compilation target**

* You write code in other languages and compile them into WebAssembly
* Rust, C/C++, Go, C#; these are just a few of the languages with WebAssembly as a compile target

---

## But the question you then have to ask is...

---

## There are *so many reasons* you would want this in your life

---

# THIS IS **A NEW ERA FOR THE WEB**

# No but seriously

WebAssembly is comprable to bringing the power of the JVM **into the browser**, creating an **evolution of the web as we know it**.

# Why does this matter?

* Augmenting JS at its not-so-strong points
* Not rewriting entire codebases to use them on the web
* Fewer calls to the server, less latency, faster web apps

---

# Augmenting JS at its not-so-strong points

Who wants to write a banking app in JS?

If you're running *anything that relies on mathematical numerical accuracy or speed* that meant, until now, another AJAX call to have another language do alllllllll the math. *With WebAssembly*, we can do this in the browser, with, say, Rust.

---

# Other JS not-so-strong points

* Type coercion side-effects: `"" == 0 //true`
* API Overloads:

```
1 + document.getElementById("inputElem").value; // Concatenates
1 + Number(document.getElementById("inputElem").value); // Adds
```

* The mystery that is `typeof`

```
typeof {} === "object" //true
typeof "" === "string" //true
typeof [] === "array"; //false
```

## Using WebAssembly means *using the right tool for the job*

---

# BUT THIS WILL KILL JS!!!

### No, it *makes JS better* by letting it do what it is good at and ignoring the rest.

---

## It *makes the web better* by creating better browser experiences

# Let's *take a closer look* with a demo

---

# The Demo

* uses wasm-imagemagick
* manipulates images in the browser up to 10x faster than JS can
* Shows the real power of not having to rewrite code and being able to let us use the right tool for the job

---

# But what about *Node.JS*?

---

# Wait...

---

# What *ABOUT* Node.JS?!?!

# Native. Heccin. Modules.

---

# Why native modules are such a pain

* They have to be recompiled on download
* They either have to compile on every platform OR leave off platforms from support
* Node-Gyp (disclaimer: I respecc the hecc out of their work.)

---

# WebAssembly *Works on Node >= 8.0*

---

---

# WebAssembly Modules in Node.JS

* Are *precompiled for Node.JS*, so they're portable to *any platform that runs Node.JS*.
* No more recompilation on every download on every architecture.
* FOR REALS.

# WebAssembly is even invading serverless

# We have a free tier now!

(I'll show this again later)

---

# The point of this talk

* Try WebAssembly (I personally really like Rust)
* WebAssembly is the future of JS in all its forms
* If you are a hiring manager; *hire someone who is different from you*. Just go and do it.
